<h3>Data Analysis Process:</h3>

- **Ask Questions about the data**

  to focus on relevant parts of your data and direct analysis towards meaningful insights

- **Data Wrangling**

  to start answering your question, you should start wrangling and cleaning your data to put it in a good quality.

- **Data Exploration and Explanation**

  - **univariate analysis**

    investigate distributions of individual variables

  - **bivariate analysis**

    investigate relationships between pairs of variables in your data.

  - **multivariate analysis**

    investigate in three or more variables in the data.

- **Draw Conclusions**

  get your conclusions from descriptive or inferential statistics or applying machine learning models 

- **Communicate your results**

  share and report what you have built. and remember, your analysis is only as valuable as your ability to communicate it.
